                             In brief, Che Guevara was a prominent communist figure in the Cuban Revolution who went on to become a guerrilla leader in South America. 
                             <br>Executed by the Bolivian army in 1967, he has since been regarded as a martyred hero by generations of leftists worldwide. 
                             <br> Guevara’s image remains a prevalent icon of leftist radicalism and anti-imperialism.
                             The revolutionary leader was born Ernesto Guevara de la Serna on June 14, 1928, in Rosario, Argentina.
                             <br> After completing his medical studies at the University of Buenos Aires, Guevara became politically active first in his native Argentina and then in neighboring Bolivia and Guatemala.<br>

                             <br> Since his death, Guevara has become a legendary political figure. 
                             <br> His name is often equated with rebellion, revolution, and socialism. Others, however, have remembered that he could be ruthless and ordered prisoners executed without trial in Cuba.
